Her research focuses on the interaction between homotopic visual and attention areas, and the impact of that interaction on behavior. She investigates large- and fine-scale dependency within and between networks which result in stable sensory perception. To answer her research questions, she uses eye-tracking, brain stimulation with TMS and tES, and brain imaging using fMRI (3T & 7T) and EEG.

speakers_description:  Nicholas Gaspelin is an associate professor in the Department of Psychological Sciences at the University of Missouri. His research aims to understand the cognitive and neural mechanisms of selective attention in humans using psychophysical techniques, eye tracking, and electroencephalograms (EEG). Much of his research has evaluated whether certain kinds of salient information have the power to “capture” attention and how individuals learn to ignore distracting information. He is currently funded by an NSF CAREER award to study the relationship of eye movements and covert attentional processes using concurrent EEG and eye-tracking.https://gaspelinlab.missouri.edu
