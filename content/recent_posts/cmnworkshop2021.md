Short_description: The Center for Multimodal Neuroimaging is thrilled to announce the upcoming workshop on Naturalistic Stimuli and Individual Differences with a range of extramural and intramural speakers presenting on their cutting-edge work.  The workshop seeks to (1) bring together top scientists using naturalistic stimuli and/or the study of individual differences in neuroimaging; (2) showcase theoretical, methodological, and analytical advances in these areas of research; and (3) serve as a catalyst for collaborations between presenters, biomedical NIH researchers, and experts from around the world. <br/>Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the workshop will feature virtual pre-recorded presentations and roundtables open to the public.  Presentations will be available to stream on-demand starting Monday August 2, 2021.  Attendees (free registration information below) will be able to view the presentations in their own time, and submit questions to speakers through an online portal until the end of August.  In September, the speakers will again virtually reconvene for a round-table discussion to address some of the attendee questions as well as discuss larger questions in the field moving forward. <br/>Full workshop: <p>Full workshop:&nbsp;<a href="https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=42538">https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=42538</a><br>Roundtable #1:&nbsp;<a href="https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=44048" title="https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=44048">https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=44048</a><br>Roundtable #2:&nbsp;<a href="https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=44065" title="https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=44065">https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=44065</a></p>

speakers_description:  Talk Title: <b>"Tracking changes in narrative responses across learning and development"</b><br/>Chris Baldassano is currently an Assistant Professor in the Psychology Department at Columbia University. He was an undergraduate in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University, received his PhD in Computer Science at Stanford University, and was a postdoc at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. His lab's research focuses on how knowledge about the world - including semantic knowledge, temporal structure, spatial maps, or schematic scripts - is used to understand and remember complex naturalistic experiences. By applying machine learning techniques to data from behavioral and neuroimaging experiments, his work aims to uncover how dynamic representations in the mind and brain during perception lead to the formation of event memories.View Talk

speakers_description:  Talk Title: <b>"Memory for narratives and other naturally-occurring experiences"</b><br/>Janice Chen is an assistant professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. Her lab investigates the neural systems, processes and representations underlying human episodic memory as it manifests in naturalistic settings and behaviors. To this end, her experiments utilize dynamic stimuli such as audiovisual movies and interactive stories, and daily-life activities such as spoken conversation and web browsing.

speakers_description:  Talk Title: <b>"Idiosynchrony"</b></br> As the director of the Functional Imaging & Naturalistic Neuroscience (FINN) Lab, Emilyâ€™s work is focused on individual variability in brain activity and behavior, especially as it relates to appraisal of ambiguous information under naturalistic conditions (i.e., watching movies, listening to stories). She is particularly interested in how and why different individuals can arrive at different interpretations of the same information, and when and where this divergence can be detected and predicted from high-dimensional patterns of brain activity.View Talk

speakers_description:  Talk Title: <b>"Individual differences in resting-state fMRI"</b><br/>I am a biomedical engineer (Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN) who uses fMRI to understand how the human brain works. My research has two main focuses: improving fMRI as a tool to study brain function, while also trying to understand what it is that the brain does when left to its own shenanigans (e.g., resting-state fMRI). More specifically, I am interested in fMRI denoising methods such as those based on multi-echo data, the development of real-time fMRI methods, understanding the different sources of variability in resting-state functional connectivity, and the relationship between free thought and the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity.View Talk

He received his Ph.D. in Neurobiology from the Weizmann Institute in Israel. He was a postdoctoral fellow at NYU before moving to Princeton. His research program aimed to understand how the brain processes real-life complex information and interacts with the environment; with a focus on integration of complex information over time and the interaction between two individuals and two brains during natural communication.View Talk

speakers_description:  Talk Title:<b>"Bigger needles, smaller haystacks: The use of movies in developmental fMRI research."</b><br/>I am a child psychiatrist and investigator at the University of British Columbia where I run the Naturalistic Neuroimaging Lab. We use naturalistic conditions to study neural responses, with a focus on child psychiatric disorders.  The work includes producing and testing novel movie paradigms (e.g.,Inscapes), developing methods that leverage the signal variability in movie-watching in unique ways and studying movie-watching as a brain state (www.headspacestudios.org).This talk will present new data on how movies can decrease noise and increase certain signal properties. I will also introduce a novel movie-based symptom provocation paradigm (calledAll Day Wrong)that we created to evoke symptoms in childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder.View Talk

His research focuses on statistical modeling for neuroimaging and behavioral data analysis. In recent years, he has been adopting the multilevel modeling framework and Bayesian inferences to various issues such as multiple testing adjustment, test-retest reliability, experimental design, generalizability, naturalistic scanning data analysis, nonlinearity, model efficiency, and data with complex hierarchical structures (e.g., repeated measures, missing data, genetic relatedness).View Talk
