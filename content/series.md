Invited speakers work at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. They come to the NIH for one or two days to present their research at the Talk Series, but also to meet with NIH researchers with shared interests. Talks include discussions on new machine learning methods as well as applications of machine learning to neuroscience research.</p>
