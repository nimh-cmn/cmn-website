<p>The Machine Learning in Brian Imaging Series is a talk series sponsored by the NIMH that takes place every month on NIH main campus in Bethesda, MD. Invited speakers work at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. They come to the NIH for one or two days to present their research at the Talk Series, but also to meet with NIH researchers with shared interests. Talks include discussions on new machine learning methods as well as applications of machine learning to neuroscience research. Previous speakers in the series include: Dr. Tulay Adali (University of Maryland), Dr. Joshua Vogelstein (John Hopkins University), Dr. Christopher Honey (John Hopkins University), Dr. Vernon Lawhern (Army Research Lab), <a href="#">Dr. Jonas Richiardi (Lausane University Hospital)</a>, <a href="#">GaÃ«l Varoquaux (INRIA)</a> and <a href="#">Dr. Yoshua Bengio (University of Montreal)</a>.</p>
