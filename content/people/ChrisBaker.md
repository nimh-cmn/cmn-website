Bio: Chris Baker is Chief of the Section on Learning and Plasticity in the Laboratory of Brain and Cognition at NIMH. He received his PhD from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland (working with Dave Perrett) before conducting postdoctoral studies at Carnegie Mellon University (working with Carl Olson and Marlene Behrmann) and MIT (working with Nancy Kanwisher). One major research focus is on understanding how high-level visual information is represented in the brain, and how such representations are modified by experience. His lab uses multidisciplinary approaches to tackle these questions including neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG), brain stimulation (TMS) and behavioral approaches.
